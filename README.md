# PyBer Analysis
Module 5

## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
An inital analyysis was completed and presented on ride-sharing data provided by the company PyBer. This analysis included a bubble chart comparing average fare to total number of rides per city, 3 different box-and-whisker plots to compare number of rides, fare, and number of drivers each against city type, and 3 different pie charts to compare percent of total fares, percent of total rides, and percent of total drivers each against city type. The CEO has requested a table (DataFrame) that summarizes all of the data by city type, as well as a multiple-line chart of total fares by city type. The line chart will breakdown fares by date, resulting in conclusions based on timing.
